PhotoPrism: Computer Vision Models
==================================

Supplementary computer vision models that can be used with PhotoPrism.

## Installing Build Dependencies

Please make sure that you have Git and Python 3 installed on your system. On Ubuntu/Debian Linux you can run the following command for this:

```
sudo apt-get install -y git python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-wheel
```

You can then proceed with the installation of the Python dependencies in a virtual environment by either using the `Makefiles` (run `make` in the main project directory) or by manually running the following commands in the respective subdirectory, e.g.:

```bash
cd describe
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
./venv/bin/pip3 install --disable-pip-version-check -r requirements.txt
```
